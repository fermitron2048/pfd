# Primary Flight Display

I thought it would be fun to make a partial replica of a 737-800NG primary flight display for my Jeep.  I re-created the features that are most recognizable, and that would be most useful in a vehicle.  Not everything is finished yet, but the main components work, except for the artifical horizon.  I also added some features that aren't normally on a PFD, such as inside and outiside air temperature and humidity, time, and status information.

It runs on the Raspberry Pi platform.  Here's what I'm using:
* [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+][9]
* [The official 7â€³ touchscreen display for Raspberry Pi][10]
* [Enclosure][11]

You can get the simulator up and running in Ubuntu, and see it in action by replaying canned data.  In order to use it in a vehicle, you'll need to make one or both of the [sensor packs](https://github.com/fermitron2048/pfd/tree/master/sensors).  The Main Sensors include a [GPS receiver][1] for location and orientation, a [BNO055][2] accelerometer/gyroscope for yaw, pitch, and roll angles, a [BME280][3] sensor for pressure and temperature/humidity (displayed above and right of center), and a [TSL2561][4] light sensor for dimming the display.  I'm using an [ESP32][5] microcontroller, which supports the GPS receiver and WiFi for streaming parameters to the Raspberry Pi at 10Hz.  The OAT Baro sensor pack include two [BMP388][6] low noise pressure sensors, and a [DS18B20][7] weatherproof temperature sensor for outside air temperature (displayed above and left of center).  It uses the [ESP8266][8] microcontroller, which is lower cost and speed.  The BMP388's can be used as precision altimiters, and the code averages the outputs together for increased accuracy.

Here is what it looks like assembled:

## Installation

The PFD requires python3.  The main dependencies are [pygame][12] and [numpy][13], for graphics and data processing.  When running on the RPi, [ft5406][14] is needed for touch event handling.  Otherwise it is mainly platform independent, except that the fonts don't always render correctly outside of Raspbian/Ubuntu.

Install main dependencies:
```
$ pip3 install pygame
```

```
$ pip3 install numpy
```

Install ft5406:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/pimoroni/python-multitouch.git
...
$ cd library
$ sudo python3 setup.py install
```

To run the display:
```
$ python3 pfd.py
```

And then to feed the pre-canned sensor data into the simulator:
```
$ python3 data/csv2net.py data/sensordata.bin.csv
```

If you run it on a Raspberry Pi, you'll need to setup the RPi as a wireless access point, and configure the sensor packs to connect to it for streaming data.  

## Altimeter setting

Each time a pilot flies a real airplane, they need to adjust the altimeter so that it displays the correct altitude for the current atmospheric pressure, and the same is needed with the altimeter in this PFD.  To adjust the altimeter:

* Touch or click the "Baro Set" button on the display
  * The current sea level pressure is displayed in Hectopascals
* Use the arrows to adjust each number
  * Either adjust the values to match the sea level pressure (in hPa) reported by the nearest airport, or
  * Adjust the values until the smaller altitude value matches the elevation of your current location

There are currently two alternate mechanisms for altimeter correction.  You can create calibration waypoints that will automatically adjust the altimeter to match your current elevation when you traverse the waypoint.  To do this, you can add your own waypoints to [jeepconfig.json](jeepconfig.json).  Here is an example:

```
{
	"calibrationpoints": 
	[
		{
			"latitude": 47.614134,
			"longitude": -122.193598,
			"variance": 0.000125,
			"elevation": 147
		},
...
```

You just specify the coordinates of the waypoint in decimal degrees, then specify how far away from the waypoint is needed to trigger it, and finally specify what the elevation is at that waypoint.  For example, if you want to trigger a calibration when you traverse 47.6140, -122.1930, and you specify a variance of 0.0001, it will trigger if you are within the bounding box:
* 47.6139, -122.1929
* 47.6141, -122.1931

The other mechanism for altimeter correction is automatic elevation state saving.  As you drive around, the current elevation is regularly written to a file.  When the RPi is shut off, the file contains the last known elevation (typically of the place you parked).  When you turn on the RPi again, it reads the file and calculates the current sea level pressure based on the pressure at the current elevation.  This happens automatically at startup, so make sure to wait to move the vehicle until it has loaded the state file.  

## Heading calibration

Since the accelerometer data is oriented as 0 degrees forward instead of 0 degrees north, the code has to find the offset to true north.  It does this by continuously monitoring the GPS bearing parameter, and when it has changed little for the last several seconds, it averages the GPS bearing and accelerometer bearing, and calculates the average difference between the two.  From that point on, the display will show the accelerometer bearing plus the difference (offset).  As you drive around, the offset will update again when you are driving straight.

The bearing offset is also stored in the same state file that contains the last known elevation, and it is restored on power up.  Since the heading indicator and altimeter use the accelerometer and pressure sensors, the display still updates even when the GPS signal is lost, like when driving through a tunnel.

## Time Display

The date and time on the bottom right of the display comes from the GPS receiver, and is about as accurate as the screen refresh rate on the RPi.  When replaying canned data to the simulator, the time display represents the time that the data was collected and stored.  There is no need to synchronize the clock on the RPi to get accurate time.  The timezone is currently hard-coded to GMT minus 8 hours, and this needs to be moved to the config file.

## FPS

There is a Frames Per Second indicator on the bottom left.  This isn't necessary, but can be helpful for troubleshooting.

## RX

The RX1 and RX2 indicators show the receive status of the two sensor packs.  RX1 is for the Main Sensors, and RX2 is for the OAT Baro sensors.  They show green if the RPi has received a packet from the sensor pack within 0.15 seconds.  Since the data streams at 10Hz (every 0.1 seconds), the packet is late at 0.15 seconds.  When it is late, the light turns red.  When a packet is received again, the light turns green again.
